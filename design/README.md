# Design Assets

This directory contains design assets for the AI Assistants Suite.

## Files

- `mockups/bot-suite-v1.jpg` - Main design mockup (place your mockup here)
- `html/current-mockup.html` - HTML version of the mockup (preserved structure)

## Usage

The frontend (`frontend/index.html`) is based on the structure and styling from `html/current-mockup.html`. Key design elements preserved:

- Sidebar layout with bot selection
- Chat interface with message bubbles
- User profile section (visual only)
- Conversation management
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Design Constraints

- Bot bubble color: #F3E1C2 (user's preferred color)
- Disabled bots show "Coming soon" badge
- Login/account UI is visual only (non-functional)
- Preserve accessibility features and keyboard navigation
